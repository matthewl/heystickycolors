# Sticky colors

As an exercise for seeing how rusty my Stimulus knowledge is. Hey's sticky notes on your inbox is nice, but I wanted to see what we could do to add some color options to those stickies.

## Getting up and running

Run `rails app:create_stickies` to create some stickies.

Run `bin/dev` to start the app.

The app will fetch the stickies from the database and allow you to change the colour of the stickies with the color selector at the top right of each sticky.
